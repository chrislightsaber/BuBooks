For me, this was the first online class I had taken so I was previously nervous about the workload. However, I thought the course went along well even with retaining an internship. There were weekly quizzes, daily posts or response questions, a midterm, and a final. Readings were about 20-30 pages in length per day, which was very manageable. Would 100% take his course again.<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>A</p></td>

After completing my degree at Baylor, I felt it necessary to leave a review for my absolute favorite teacher on campus. Dr. Morera teaches with so much passion you cannot help but be interested in the subject matter, if solely only because his interest in it is so radiant. On top of that, the assignments are not over the top and the tests are graded very fairly. You will do well in this course if you care even a little, and will excel if you also enjoy history. In short, you'd be mistaken to take any other history professor if you can help it. And personally I think his < 70 rating is a joke that shows most students, like myself, that enjoyed his class didn't think to write a review for it.<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>A</p></td>

I have had him for a lecturer in two courses and both were eye-opening, deeply immersive, and interesting to learn about. Morera is extremely capable of offering help when you need it and is a very understanding person. He clearly puts the importance of his students' understanding of history before anyone else, and always effectively teaches the material. The workload is fine as its simply reading assignments he occasionally picks up a review for. Bottom line: Go for the immersive lectures and direct teacher-student communication, stay for the witty sarcasm and corny jokes.<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>B+</p></td>

History is not my strong suit and for this class I just did what I had to do to get by, but I still ended up with an A. Morera is kind and funny. The lectures feel long and boring, but thats also because I don't particularly like history. He is reasonable with assignments and outlines exactly what he expects, so you aren't blind sided. He really cares about his students and makes sure you understand the material. For the test, he gives you 12 topics to know information about and he picks 3 of them for the test which you choose 2 to write about. He workshops some of the topics in class and he's always happy to help you with anything in his office hours. You also have two papers. The first is over the Epic of Gilgamesh which he discusses in class and helps you to understand exactly what he is looking for. I didn't read the book, but I still got an A on the paper. The second paper is over a topic in the book. He also gives opportunities for extra credit. There are map quizzes every friday, but they are not hard. In addition, there are reading questions due every day, but they do not take long to do and if you don't do them before class he usually allows you to email it to him before the end of the day. I highly recommend Morera. He is kind, reasonable, and really loves history and his students. The class is not difficult if you do the work which is in no way excessive.<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>A</p></td>

All you need to do to prepare for his test is take the list of subjects on the study guide and outline a few good points under who, what,where, when, and why. He even lets you make a bulleted list on the test instead of making you write actual essays. He also has ample extra credit opportunities.

				<td colspan="4"><p><b>Comments</b>:1305 - LISTEN CAREFULLY!!!! There are good and very bad things about this professor. Some of the good things: he is funny and engaging in class, very sweet and helpful. He really cares about his students outside lives and will show it very clearly. The only work outside of class will be reading questions and studying for map quizzes(there is one every friday). The BAD: you don't know when he is going to take them up and there are assigned ones for everyday. He expects reading questions, essays, papers, extra credit, and ID's(on exams) to be "microlevel"(his words) in detail. He wants you to VERY SERIOUSLY analyze EVERYTHING. None of his required work can be answered simply. On map quizzes you have to memorize every city/rive/lake/landmark/ocean/gulf/country/etc on each of the maps because you dont know what he is going to quiz you on. HIS EXAMS: He has two exams- a midterm and a final. THE MIDTERM: you have 50 minutes to write 2 essays, no notes, he will give you a review that has 12 concepts and you must answer the who/what/when/where/why on each and from those 12 he will pick 3 for the exam(he doesnt tell you which) and you have to pick two of the three and write 2 pages on each. You must do this from memory. THE FINAL: the final is the same as the midterm but he also ADDS 4 essay prompts to the test review, from those 4 he will put 2 on the exam(you wont know which) and you must answer one of the two in 3-4 pages. STUDYING FOR THE EXAMS: you have all of the test reviews at the first day in canvas and all of the powerepoints (etc), for each exam you will have to prepare by writing 2 pages for each concept and 4 pages for each essay- and then MEMORIZE THEM IN AS MUCH DETAIL.

NOTE!!!!!!!!!: HIS GRADING DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER, YOU WILL NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MADE UNTIL SCORES COME OUT.
DO BOTH EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES!

				<td colspan="4"><p><b>Comments</b>:1305 - I would not recommend him, however if you do take his class, you'll be fine. It is the most work that I have ever had for a class. The exam preparation is not terrible if you study a few nights before the exam- DO NOT CRAM. He will give you a study guide with about 12 general concepts (ex: Charlemagne), but will ask you to choose 2 of 3 that he chooses on exam day. From there you are to answer the 5 W's about the concept and if you want an A, each concept should cover 1-2 pages. So essentially what I am telling you is that in order to do well, you will prepare 12, 2 page essays to prepare. The same goes for his final, except in addition to that, you have to prepare 4 true essays where ultimately you will write a 3-4 page paper in a bluebook where you choose 1 of the 2 prompts he selects that day. He is an extremely difficult grader and will only give you an A if it is clear that you understand concepts in depth and at length. He is huge about thoroughness and writing a lot of information, so if you don't do that, you will never make an A. An A is definitely not impossible, but prepare to work harder than ever for it.<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>B</p></td>

				<td colspan="4"><p><b>Comments</b>:3 different courses - Morera is my favorite professor that I\'ve had in college.  I took his World History to 1500 course last year and liked it so much I have now taken two of his special topics courses.  In the basic class the workload was about average. We had weekly quizzes that were easy if you read the textbook, mostly they were geographic map quizzes.  His exams are all in a bluebook. For the 1300 level course there were identifications in which you explain a term for about a page and why it is significant (he explains it very clear in class) and there is an essay or two.  He grades tougher than most, but If you take good notes and study you should be able to make an A.  His special topics courses are the greatest thing you could do with your time if you love History during the Medieval and Renaissance periods.  The courses are discussion based and are surrounded around article reviews. You learn how to break down a scholarly article and review them and critique them.  You will learn more than you ever dreamed and the information is very interesting.  I am not a history major and you don\'t have to be one in order to succeed in the 1300 level or 4000 level courses.  He is funny and way overqualified for his 1300 level classes, but not in a bad way.  He is able to draw to other sources in history to help the student better get an understand of the scope of the topics.  HIGHLY recommend to anyone who likes history and is willing to put in a decent amount of work.  Don\'t take him if you want to slack off. He will work with you more than almost any professor I\'ve had, but you have to put in the effort. Take Morera! Could be the best decision you ever make<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>A</p></td>

Only issue I have is that his essay grading can be pretty unforgiving, but if you put forth a solid effort there's no need to worry about getting anything less than a B. Geography quizzes were not hard, just make acronyms and study memorize em minutes before you take the quiz. RQ's got pretty annoying after awhile but do them.

You have to do a Who-What-When-Where-Why format for 2 out of like 6 topics, but he gives you like 15 to study. Its a lot of material, like an unnecessary amount. Theres also the essays, which he isn\'t great at explaining. For our class he took our second essay and added it to our first essay, but not how you think. He didn\'t average the two together, nor did he add a whole new grade to boost the class average of our grade. He added up to 5 points to our first essay, which I did the night before and didn\'t do to well. So I was banking on my second one, which I did much better on. It only added 2 points to my 67 essay, making it now a 69 which did NOTHING for my average. He is really bad at lecturing, tries to be funny, and is just boring most of the time. PLEASE don\'t take him, try to find someone else who might actually be better at their job. You also have geography quizzes each week, which have nothing to do with the tests or the final, so memorize it and forget it is what I did. Made no sense, and didnt help us in the class at all.<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>B</p></td>

BUT as the semester continued, his class became one of the most interesting, relaxed courses I've taken at Baylor. He is a young teacher, which I think factors into his kind and understanding demeanor; the evening before our first essay was due, he emailed our class to give us some tips, and noted that we would probably stay up working on our paper. What stuck with me was what he wrote after that statement, about how he said that not out of judgement, but out of understanding of our workload and our general interest in getting good grades. He manages his class in such a way, pushing back paper deadlines to allow sufficient time to review his comments on the previous paper. He even allowed our second paper to be a full revision of the previous paper, because he felt that our class hadn't done our best work. Overall, he's a fantastic professor. He only keeps one official office hour, but he's highly flexible about meeting outside of that hour, granted you request an appointment. Also, he teaches primarily from a slideshow, which can be incredibly boring, but make sure you listen for when he give his analysis of the situation, or makes sassy/punny comments. The analysis is essential for the exams, and the comments are surprisingly wonderful memory-aids.<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>A</p></td>

Pros: 
-He is willing to go over your work before you turn it in.
-He teaching style is kind of likable in a dorky way. 
Cons: 
- Not willing to meet outside office hours 
- Has a set opinion and if he doesn't like your ideas he will slash your essay grade (so basically the safer you play it on your essay the better) 
- Every thing you do in this class is essay and his feedback is mostly scribbles so you have to go to his office hours to clarify everything 
- He basically makes you write an essay to petition for a grade change if he marked something wrong and you were right, and you likely won't be getting your points back anyway 
- Crazy amount of reading
- You'll have response questions you have to do EVERYDAY that he will take up randomly and if you don't write like two pages of info you'll get a horrible grade and all he will write is "unpack" 
- You'll have geo quizzes once a week on top of the response questions 

This class will consume your semester! You have been warned!<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>B+</p></td>

He has interesting anecdotes about every topic. The work is not necessarily easy, but he is very clear about his expectations and makes himself available to his students. There are only two exams (a midterm and a final), both of which do require a decent amount of preparation and quite a bit of writing. However, he is more than willing to specify what information should be emphasized and will look over your sample ID's and give you feedback prior to the exam. If you like interesting, caring professors and would like to actually learn about history (and not just memorization of random dates and names with no legitimate context), you should probably take Dr. Morera.<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>A</p></td>

				<td colspan="4"><p><b>Comments</b>:HIS 1305 - TAKE THIS MAN's COURSE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!  He is a great Professor for numerous reasons but here's the shirt list 1) he gives you an exact calendar of assigned readings and assignments (there are no surprises that can hurt you!) 2) he is approachable and free to talk to after class or during office hours 3) his love for history makes the vanilla text vibrant and intriguing. Dr. Morera's class is all about three things 1) analysis of assigned readings and material 2) reflection and digestion of those materials 3) the synthesis between the cold hard facts and your perspective of the world. Your grade is governed by your performance on Response Questions(15%) Geography Quizzes (15%) two essays (20%) two exams (50%). In order to be successful on these different exercises I recommend ALWAYS reading the assigned material in advance (don't forget to take notes; these will be a savior when studying for the exams!!!) and then taking separate notes when in class (this repetitive journaling will really help u see connections that u may otherwise miss). As for the essays I found my first grade to be disappointing and so I went to talk to Dr. M about it. He pointed out my flaws and how I could improve my style and strengthen my argument. Don't expect a  large number of marks on your essay, if u are truly upset or saddened with your result then it should not be that hard to go talk to the man himself. Also, know that u can show him a rough draft before the due date, which he will go over with u. The class is not difficult for those who work for what they earn, but those of you who expect something for nothing are going to be dissatisfied. I will now close with a completely subjective opinion about my experience while in this class. Learning from the texts in this class was wonderfully informative and interesting but that is not what makes this class so special. Instead it is the suggested readings outside of the curriculum that have lead to a significant amount of self realization (ask him about these sometime after class or better yet during office hours.) By recommending this information and discussing it with me Dr. Morera has made me a better man and pursuer of knowledge. What more can u ask for?<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>A</p></td>

				<td colspan="4"><p><b>Comments</b>:HIS 1305 and 1307 - I had Dr. Morera for both semesters of my freshman year and I say with conviction that he is by far, the best teacher that I have had to date.  Firstly, he is very clear about all his expectations from the very beginning and there are no secrets or surprises.  His syllabus is the primary method for making his expectations known and it is (once again) abundantly clear and he does everything in his power to stick to it.  Secondly, his in-class experience is one of a kind.  Yes, he has classes that are primarily lecture-centered, however these are fairly rare on the schedule in comparison to discussion based learning.  There is a considerable amount of reading for the class as a result of this, but only in preparation for class time.  With that reading, he assigns Reading Questions--thought-provoking prompts that encourage students to bring their best ideas to the table during discussion.  He goes out of his way to foster an environment of group collaboration that manages to stay very focused even when led by students--something that many professors find difficult to maintain.  He has this ability to make the mundane, engaging--the tedious, a challenge--and the historic, current and relevant.  Though he teaches for the full class period, it flies by.  He has a command of the English language that a student can't help but admire and it is fascinating to hear him once he gets going.  Perhaps the most important detail about Dr. Morera is his kindness that overflows into every aspect of his class.  Not only is he respectful and courteous to his students, but he actually cares about them personally.  He knows everyone by name, knows how they learn, and is very conscious of their abilities.  He knows his tests are difficult and because of that, he also knows how to provide the tools for each and every student to succeed.  And because it is a chief concern of students everywhere, YES he gives ample extra credit opportunities and is very understanding and cooperative with students that are willing to work for their success.  He is also compassionate beyond belief--something that I had personal experience with during a particularly rough second semester.  He is always there to talk if you need something, whether it be directly pertaining to the course or not.  He is the kind of professor that should set the bar for all others out there and I cannot emphasize this enough.<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>B</p></td>

Although there is heavy reading and a fair bit of study, you will easily learn with Dr. Morera.  He is a world history expert and is very knowledgeable of concepts taught in the course.  Sometimes he likes to throw in a few jokes into his lectures, which can brighten the dullness if you do not care for history.  I actually love history, which is probably why I like Dr. Morera very much. Overall, you WILL learn if you have Dr. Morera as a history professor.<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>A</p></td>

One day one he handed out a big think syllabus that told us all his expectations of us, as well as everthing we'd be covering throughout the semester and all the due dates for assignments. In addition to just lecturing at us, he also broke up the class into groups for discussions and used powerpoints with lots of notes and pictures (which he posted onto BB for us). He handed out assignment sheets, study guides and his grading criteria before each paper or test, and reviewed with us before each test. If you went to his office hours he even was willing to look over drafts of things before you turned them in. So really, besides writing our papers for us and taking our exams, what else could the guy have done?<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>B+</p></td>

great teacher, if your a good writer your fine.

He gives a quiz every wednesday, even though you do have to read for them if you listen in class they are pretty easy. He gives A LOT of extra credit so if you don't do well on the essays and midterm he gives changes to redeem yourself. History, of course is a lecture class but he makes it fun. He has a sense of humor and tries really hard to make it interesting. I personally really enjoyed his class. I have never gotten an A in a history course before until I took his class.

After taking a step back to analyze my performance it became clear that it was my mistakes that costed me, not his grading style.  I altered my writing technique on the essays and wrote out detailed responses to the study guides.  The improvement on those two fronts, coupled with the ease of the map quizzes, helped raise my grade significantly.  I rarely said anything in class but he still noticed that I was an intelligent student that understood the subject matter and treated me with respect when I talked to him.  In general, his teaching style and personality took some getting used to but I was content with my decision to take his class.  However, if you are not willing to make adjustments to how you handle the course or if you do not have thick skin, do not take his class.<B>&nbsp; - Grade In Class:</b>B</p></td>

His tests are virtually impossible to be successful on. I have never had below a B on an exam and normally get As but after studying for over 10 hours for his exams I still fail. He asks for things like why an event was significant and you have to find your answer from the book. However, if you don't use the same example as him you are marked as wrong, even if your answer is also correct. I don't know any of my fellow classmates who are successful in this class either. Not only will you learn nothing, you will be so frustrated with the impossibility of receiving an A that you will want to yank out your hair. This is the only college course I have not been able to get an A in even though I've put more time and effort in to this class than any other. And in the end I've learned nothing from all of it.
