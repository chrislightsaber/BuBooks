    <p><font size="3">B</font>UBooks.com was founded by two Baylor Sophomores who got tired of losing so much money to the Baylor Bookstore. We set this up as a free service to help out our fellow Baylor students buy and sell their used textbooks. We recently finished ProfRate, Baylor's first FREE professor rating service. We hope to provide this service to ALL Baylor students in the coming years. In the future, we hope to improve our service to include a message board and a national textbook search engine.</p>
    <p><b><u>FYI</u></b> - We are constantly trying to improve the features and the quality of the website. We would appreciate an e-mail to if you have ANY problem with the website. Once the problem is known, we can quickly fix it. Also any suggestions or ideas of what Baylor students would like to add to Bubooks.com would be greatly appreciated.</p>
